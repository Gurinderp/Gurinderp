<h3>Hello World :earth_americas: :earth_africa: :earth_asia:</h3>
<h4>:star:My name is Gurinderpreet, or Gurinder for short.:star:</h4>
<h4>I am a FullStack Developer with a certificate from the UC Davis Coding Bootcamp. I began my journey with basic web development - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - and later enrolled in a bootcamp to learn the MERN stack. I am currently working on adding skills to my arsenal. :sweat_smile: </h4> 

<h4>My current venture includes diversifying my experience with JavaScript and I am also improving my work with Python and PHP.</h4>
